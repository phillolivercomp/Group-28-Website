				<p>DDOS attacks and the laws surrounding them differs between countries and also many states in america where DDoS attacks have seen a lot of media attention. In the UK, people found guilty of carrying out a denial of service attack can see up to 10 years in prison as of 2006 under the Police and Justice Act. In America, A DoS attack is seen as a federal crime with the penalty being years in prison also. However, this current precedent is being challenged with a court proceeding in California.</p>

				<p>Many people are calling for the reclassification of DDoS attacks to be a legal form of protest. Much like sit-ins or the "Occupy" movement, a DDoS attack aims to prevent people from accessing a certain place for a certain period of time. Instead of this being physical though, it is done by a virtual medium. A DDoS attack is also non intrusive meaning servers are not usually at "hacked" and are instead just shut down.</p>

				<p>However, in those provinces where DoS attacks are not legal, a business can still take measures against the attacker if they can attain a valid IP address of their location. This will usually involve contacting the internet service provider of the IP address given to be the attacking address. From this, the victim can then provide evidence against the individual which may lead to temporary or even permanent suspension of their internet access rights.</p>

				<p>In some cases of DoS attacks though, attackers can be using blackmail as a way of extracting money from a company for allowing their attacks to seize. In these cases, with evidence provided and an attack taken place, Law enforcement can and should be called and this would recieve the same penalties as blackmail.</p>

				<p>An example of such an attack would be the attack that began against the company "Basecamp". Although the attack has not been resolved and the culprets not found, the company has gone on record to say the attacks were blackmail-fueled with the individual/group saying the attack would have been prevented if the company paid them off.</p>
