				<p>DoS Attacks has had an increasingly large impact on websites in recent years. As a direct result of this, it has gathered 
				a lot of attention in the media. Whether the attacks are directed through everyday mobile applications like SnapChat or world 
				wide attacks effecting the speed of the internet as a whole, every site is at risk to DoS attacks. Here are some of the most

					<h2>[11/02/14] The Independent - World's largest Denial of Service attack caused by vulnerability in the infrastructure of the web</h2>
					<p>"Hackers have exploited a key vulnerability in the infrastructure of the internet to mount what has been described by security 
					researchers as the world’s largest Denial of Service (DoS) attack.</p>
					<p>Hacks of this type are used to overwhelm web services by flooding them with requests for data and are a key weapon in the arsenal 
					of hacking collectives such as Anonymous as well as government bodies.</p>
					<p>The severity of DoS attacks are measured in gigabits-per-second (Gbps), with this recent example tipping 400Gbps – more than 
					100gbps larger than the previous record. The destructive traffic was absorbed by the servers of CloudFlare, a company that specialises 
					in protecting against just such attacks.</p>
					<p>Matthew Prince, the chief executive of CloudFlare, <a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/433044201807159296">commented on Twitter:</a>

					<h2>[10/02/14] The Register - Snapchat bug lets hackers aim DENIAL of SERVICE attacks at your mobile</h2>
					<p>"A security consultant who works for Telefonica has turned up a bug in how Snapchat handles authentication tokens, 
					which enables a denial-of-service attack against users' phones.</p>
					<p>It's a simple enough problem, the tokens should expire, but don't. As a result, one token can be re-used on many machines, 
					and with a little scripting, all those machines can be instructed to send pictures.</p>
					<p>“That could let an attacker send spam to the 4.6 million leaked account list in less than one hour”, Sánchez writes. 
					Or, in a DoS scenario, the machines could be instructed to hose a single user.</p>
					<p>If the DoS is aimed at an iPhone, he says, it will freeze; Android phones don't seem to lock up completely, but “it does 
					slow their speed. It also makes it impossible to use the app until the attack has finished.”</p>

					<h2>[27/03/13] Cloud Flare – The DDoS That Almost Broke the Internet</h2>
					<p>"On Monday, March 18, 2013 Spamhaus contacted CloudFlare regarding an attack they were seeing against their website spamhaus.org. They signed up for 
					CloudFlare and we quickly mitigated the attack. The attack, initially, was approximately 10Gbps generated largely from open DNS recursors. On March 19, 
					the attack increased in size, peaking at approximately 90Gbps. The attack fluctuated between 90Gbps and 30Gbps until 01:15 UTC on on March 21.</p>

					in the previous blog post, CloudFlare uses Anycast technology which spreads the load of a distributed attack across all our data centers. This allowed us to 
					mitigate the attack without it affecting Spamhaus or any of our other customers. The attackers ceased their attack against the Spamhaus website four hours 
					after it started.</p>
					<p>Other than the scale, which was already among the largest DDoS attacks we've seen, there was nothing particularly unusual about the attack to this point. 
					Then the attackers changed their tactics. Rather than attacking our customers directly, they started going after the network providers CloudFlare uses for bandwidth."</p>
